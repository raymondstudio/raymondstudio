Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a freelance project (PRODUCT/TECH/BUSINESS) consultant in Hong Kong now. I enjoys working with startups.

I was a Technical Officer in HSUHK, RA (in Chinese University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Baptist University), and Software Engineer in Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) and HKCREO (a Fintech startup).

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao@icloud.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 

You can support my work by tipping me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/muyun), or send me some ETH at this address: 0xe555a409fe692879ca248970b673275010fc1ea9 .
