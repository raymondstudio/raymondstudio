Hi, I'm Raymond, educating in science and business fields have taught me to be good at novel solutions to difficult problems. Thanks to the engineering experience of working on a range of projects from telecommunication to web application to data science, I have learned to adapt to any challenge that comes my way. I can work well with challenges and uncertainty.  

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at bestraymond@icloud.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 
I am also available for project consulting, reach out if you'd like to chat.

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University. He also hold a Diploma in International Business Communication at The University of Hong Kong. Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing some new.
